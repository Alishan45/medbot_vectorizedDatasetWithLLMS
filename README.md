# medbot_vectorizedDatasetWithLLMS
This project involves creating a vectorized medical dataset by leveraging LLMs (Large Language Models) and medical books in PDF format. The medical texts were processed, converted into embeddings, and stored in a vector database for efficient retrieval. This enables semantic search and context-aware responses, making it useful for applications
